movie-explorer
----
movie-explorer is a program that allows searching for movies and looking up
information about a particular movie. Currently, the program simply displays
age information about the cast, including the average age. This program uses
the TMDb API (v3).
----


Usage:
----
movie-explorer has two modes: quiet and interactive. In quiet mode, the program
will take as arguments the search keyword and the flags specifying information
to be obtained. In interactive mode, the program will only take as arguments
the flags specifying information to be obtained. Quiet mode assumes that the
most relevant movie search result to the keyword is the one in question.


For quiet mode, run movie-explorer with the "-s 'keyword'" or
"--search='keyword'" argument, along with any other arguments necessary; e.g.:

python movie-explorer.py -a -s 'matrix'

This will return any information specified (in this case, the cast average age
calculation).


For interactive mode, run movie-explorer without the -s argument, but with the
arguments specifying information to be returned; e.g.:

python movie-explorer.py -a

The user will then be prompted for further directions; once the program
finishes, it will return any information specified.
